# adguardcli-script
My bash script for adguard-cli on linux because I'm to lazy to remember certain commands.
It installs the latest version of the software if Adguard-CLI can't be found on your system.

## Features
* Menu driven interactions with Adguard-CLI
* Option to import and export settings.
* Start or stop adguard from filtering your traffic.
* A filter section where you can update, remove, change and see your current filters.
* Auto update check for Adguard itself (Not sure if its working)
